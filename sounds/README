Hello Friends,

I created this is a collection of sound effects for autotest. 

The sounds were designed to be audibly interesting, but not too grating. Several of the sounds are subtle in nature, so they do not alarm you or bother your work neighbors (although this is subject to debate - you can always use your own sounds, if you want!).

About The Sounds
----------------
These sounds were all created several years ago on the Clavia Nord Modular, still my favlorite toy. See http://www.clavia.se for more information in this excellent instrument. Everything was recorded in 44khz 24-bit (and downsampled to 44khz 16-bit wav files) using an RME Hammerfall DSP converter. The effects were edited and processed.
