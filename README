About:
Test Notifier is a small python program that leverages inotify
(python-pyinotify http://pyinotify.sourceforge.net/) and python-notify
(libnotify) to provide popup notifications based on the output of a command that
is invoked when a matching file within an observed directory tree changes.

Dependencies:
python-pyinotify
python-notify
notification-daemon
mpg123 (for mp3 playing, other players usable)

On a debian based distro these packages could be installed with:
apt-get install python-pyinotify python-notify notification-daemon mpg123
