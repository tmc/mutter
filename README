About

Mutter is a small python program that runs a specified command when
certain conditions are met. By default it will play sounds based on the return
value of the provided command.

I intend to make it easy to write custom notifiers and smart resonders.
Think growl notifications or intelligently only running a subset of a test suite.

An example invokation might be:
`mutter -c nosetests`
which would run nosetests whenever a file under the current path is changed,
removed or added.

See `mutter --help` for more information.
